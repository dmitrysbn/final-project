MVP:

x As a user/visitor, I can contact someone to borrow a tool
x As a visitor, I can register for an account
x As a user, I can log in and log out
x As a user, I can see my profile page
x As a user, when I go to my profile page, I can see:
    - The tools I have in my inventory
    - My reviews and rating (only visible after, say, 5 reviews)

x As a user, I can add a tool to my inventory
x As a user, I can show/edit/delete a tool that I own
x As a user, I can view a tool's show page:
    - Whether the tool is out on loan
    - The current condition of the tool
    - Any special notes ("battery dies quickly", etc.)
    - The list of pictures of the tool taken by previous borrowers
    - The tool's reviews(?)


WANT TO HAVE
x As a user, I can upload my tool's images and add to my profile
x As a user, I can see another user's profile
x As a user, I can add reviews of users and borrowers
x As a user, I can add reviews of tools I've borrowed
  - (?) borrowers should be required to submit a review before borrowing another item

x As a visitor, I can search tools by attribute:
    - Name of the tool
    - Maximum distance from my current location
    - Condition of the tool
    - Lender rating
  The search results could appear alongside a mini-map, with the exact locations somehow obscured

HAPPY TO HAVE
x As a user,
x As a user, I can chat with another user
x As a user, I can reset my password
x As a user, if a certain tool is important to me, I can set it so that only users with ratings above a certain number can see the tool in their search results
